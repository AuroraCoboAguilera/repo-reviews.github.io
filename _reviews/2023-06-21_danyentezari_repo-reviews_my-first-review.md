### The Review

This is a good way to both (1) test participant familiarity with the GitHub platform and (2) practice working on GitHub.

Did you know that you could put HTML and LaTeX into Markdown? How cool is that!

Here's a picture of the GitHub logo using HTML,
<img height="150" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" />

<br/><br/>

Here's a little LaTeX equation,

$\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... \beta_n x_n + \epsilon$

<br/><br/>

Now, here's an equation for you in Python,
```
y_hat = b_0 + (b_1 * x_1) + epsilon
```

<br/><br/>

Finally, here's a nice permalink for you,

Hmmm...perhaps you could also throw a couple of `<br/>`s in the create.md file to separate the images a little more.
