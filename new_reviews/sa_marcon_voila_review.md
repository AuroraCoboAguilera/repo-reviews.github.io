## Initial Thoughts
This is a review of the [Voila](https://github.com/voila-dashboards/voila) dashboard package. Voila is an innovative tool that allows one to make a dashboard from a **Jupyter notebook**. Moreover, it can also be used as an extension for Jyputer notebook. 

Personally, I feel that this has enornous potential as a productivity booster. Some key points that will be considered are:

- Ease of installation
- Main idea of utilization
- Personal experience using the package 

## Installation

The installation is straightforward as can be seen in the image below.
